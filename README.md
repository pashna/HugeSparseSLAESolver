# System of linear algebraic equations solver.
There are two methods: **conjugate gradient** method and **Cholesky's** method, which will be chosen depends on the input date to optimize the solution.

The system is prepared and optimized to work with *extremely big sparse* matrixes and provides a stable and fast solution.

Some experiments were contacted in collaboration with Research Institute of Automation of Production Processes. 

There is a paper that describes the system and shows the experiments results:
